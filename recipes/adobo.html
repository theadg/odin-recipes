     <h1>Adobo Recipe</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Adobo, in general, can be cooked using different kinds of protein. 
            Chicken is the commonly used ingredient. Have you tried cooking Filipino 
            Chicken Adobo yet? Our tried and tested recipe should be able to help you.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pork </strong>- Use any cut of pork that you prefer. I suggest pork belly for best 
                results. However, use leaner parts if you are trying to avoid fats. Pork 
                tenderloin is a healthier choice. This is very tender and contains way 
                less fat than pork belly. You can also use other proteins such as chicken 
                and goat meat using this recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion </strong>- This recipe does not suggest the use of onion. I think that onions help improve the taste of adobo. Use red, yellow, or white onion for this recipe. Make sure to chop it into small pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Dried Bay Leaves</strong> - this is an ingredient that you can almost always find most of the time in the spice section of your local supermarket. Believe it or not, but this makes a huge difference when cooking adobo.</li>
            <li><strong>Whole Peppercorn</strong> - this is a traditional ingredient. It will not matter if you use crushed peppercorn or ground black pepper. Sichuan peppercorns are also good alternatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar </strong>- adding a teaspoon of sugar will move your pork adobo on the sweeter side. I personally love the taste of adobo with a bit of sugar.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing to do is marinate the pork belly in soy sauce and crushed garlic. It is best to marinate it overnight. If time is limited, one hour should be enough. Some like to add vinegar during the process. You may do so if preferred.</li>
            <li>Drain the marinade. Save it for later. The marinated pork needs to be browned. Heat a cooking pot. Add pork with garlic. You can also add a few tablespoons of cooking oil. Cook the pork until it turns brown.</li>
            <li>Cook the pork until tender. Do this by pouring the remaining marinade, if any. Also add water. Let the liquid boil. This is the part where I put the whole peppercorn and dried bay leaves. These ingredients complete my pork adobo. Boiling for 40 minutes should be enough to tenderize the pork. There are times when you have to cook longer.</li>
            <li>If you have not added the vinegar as part of the marinade, pour it into the pot and let it cook for 10 minutes. Salt is an optional ingredient for this recipe. Use it only if you think it is needed.</li>
        </ol>
